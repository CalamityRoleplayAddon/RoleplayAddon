A small Calamity Mod addon made for fun by a group of friends to experiment with Terraria mod development.
This mod's content is based of a Calamity-mod centric roleplay said group of friends participated in on a private server, adding various elements
that reference worldbuilding and characters from said roleplay.

Developers:
-Cheese (Programmer)
-Tsuki (Programmer, Spriter)
-Daiquiri (Spriter)
-Blobmonster (Spriter)

And special thanks to all other members of the discord server which participated in the roleplay and contributed with suggestions, testing or ideas for the mod.
